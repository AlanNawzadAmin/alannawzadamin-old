### About me

I build statistical tools for all types of biological sequence data.
In particular, I build models and tests that scale to massive modern datasets and that are provably flexible enough to fit this data.

I am a faculty fellow Courant Institute at NYU, working with the [Wilson lab](https://cims.nyu.edu/~andrewgw/).
From June to August 2023 I was a postdoc at [Jura bio](https://www.jura.bio).
I completed my PhD in the Harvard Systems Biology program supervised by [Debora Marks](https://www.deboramarkslab.com/) in 2023.
I graduated with a BS in Biochemistry and Mathematics from the University of Toronto in 2019.
