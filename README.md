### About me

I am a faculty fellow Courant Institute at NYU, working with the [Wilson lab](https://cims.nyu.edu/~andrewgw/).
I from June to August 2023 I was a postdoc at [Jura bio](https://www.jura.bio).
I completed my PhD in the Harvard Systems Biology program supervised by [Debora Marks](https://www.deboramarkslab.com/) in 2023.
I graduated with a BS in Biochemistry and Mathematics from the University of Toronto in 2019.

I work on building statistical tools for learning from biological sequence data -- learning patterns in sets of sequences or learning from experimental data.
In particular, I build flexible, often nonparametric, methods that can leverage the increasing amount of sequence data to make accurate predictions and learn new biology, in theory and in practice.
